### Gameplay ###  
The numbers represent how many mines surround that cell. The letter "F" represents a flag that is placed by the user. A dash "-" represents an empty cell. The "x"s represent the cells that contain a mine and are revealed if the player lands on a mine, which results in a loss. The player wins if they manage to reveal all the cells that do not contain a mine.
